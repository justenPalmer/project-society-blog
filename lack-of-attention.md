# Lack of Attention - The Innovation Killer

Innovation is dead. I’m not talking about incremental technological improvements. Room-sized supercomputers have been miniaturized into our pockets — but the transistor is still the core technology.

Transformative technological advancement has been stalled for over 40 years. The last major technological breakthrough in the kitchen was the microwave — and that was released to the public in the 1950s. We’re still heating with electrical resistors, flying through the air with jet turbines, and moving our goods with combustion engines.

To understand why this has happened, we must look to the source of innovation. Innovation comes from attention. What we choose to focus on is what will get developed.

The space race during the Cold War drove innovation. We had a clear objective and aligned minds and resources behind it. That attention brought the human race into a different classification of species — we became space-faring.

What do we focus on today? There hasn’t been a major species-wide objective since space. There is one glaring answer, and you’re paying attention to it now.

The internet is the largest attention sink the world has ever seen. Even the investment community is enamored with web businesses and it’s easy to see why. The five largest companies in the world all are built off the success of the internet. Stories like Zuckerburg’s are alive in the dreams of every startup founder and VC manager. But with so much attention paid to the internet, other technologies are being neglected.

We need objectives outside the world wide web. We need to focus attention on our biggest problems and seek monumental technological advancement as solutions. Let’s plant in the minds of aspiring scientists and engineers a future as optimistic and bold as we can imagine.
